Tic Tac Toe: BFS AI vs Random Agent

This is a simple implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game where Player X (AI) uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to make optimal moves, while Player O is a random agent that selects its moves randomly.

Features:
Player X (AI): Uses BFS to explore all possible moves and choose the best one.
Player O (Random Agent): Chooses a random available position for its move.
Game Over Conditions: The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a tie.
